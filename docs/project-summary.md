# Project Summary

**AutoTestMatch** is a web application designed to automate test coverage analysis. It allows users to upload functional specification documents (FSDs) and test case files to receive a detailed report on how well the tests cover the requirements. The application identifies gaps in testing, calculates coverage metrics, and provides recommendations for improvement.
